# Event Communications Recap ΓÇö 2026-08-06 CEI Labs Wargames

Full chronological log of the `CEI-LABS` relay channel conversation that drove
the event (200 messages, 2026-08-05 through 2026-08-08). Thread root:
`f086884eΓÇªcacda`.

## Phase 1 ΓÇö Server LAN Discovery & OPNsense Diagnostics (Aug 5, ~14:00ΓÇô19:00 UTC)

The event began with server LAN discovery. stoptalkingishh directed Codex 5.5
to access the OPNsense router (`192.168.10.1`) and discovered four Fedora
server candidates on `192.168.10.0/24` (`.235`, `.112`, `.192`, `.67`). Codex
5.5 verified they were pingable but SSH ports were unreachable from the agent
sandbox. Fizz discovered existing stale single-node Swarms on `.13` and `.11`
advertising dead `192.168.1.x` addresses, and noted server outbound internet
through OPNsense was non-functional.

Codex 5.6 Luna was brought in to diagnose the OPNsense WAN path ΓÇö `ue0` (Lenovo
USB-C Ethernet) reported `no carrier`, leaving the server LAN without internet
egress. The team investigated OPNsense Wi-Fi as an alternative WAN (iwm0
interface). Multiple rounds of OPNsense web GUI configuration were attempted
but the upstream connection was never successfully established.

- Outcome: operator asked to make OPNsense "just work normally with the internet
  it has," then to revert it toward baseline except local server DNS.
- Codex 5.5 / Luna did read-only checks but were repeatedly blocked ΓÇö the
  workstation couldn't reach OPNsense GUI/SSH from inside the sandbox. Outside
  the sandbox, `.13:22`, OPNsense `:443`, and external `:443` all opened.
- Swarm was already 3-node Ready/Active and the CEI stack was healthy.
- No QoS/firewall redesign was added; only local server DNS overrides were
  preserved. The router path was effectively deferred ΓÇö the platform would be
  re-homed instead.

## Phase 2 ΓÇö Server Provisioning & Swarm Formation (Aug 5, ~19:00ΓÇô23:30 UTC)

stoptalkingishh provided Fedora credentials (`ismaelrodriguez/Alpha4n/a`) after
noting the login was consistent across all boxes. Servers were renamed by
processor/RAM convention:

| IP | Hostname | Spec |
|----|----------|------|
| `192.168.10.13` | `cei-ryzen5-61g-swarm01` | AMD Ryzen 5, 61 GiB |
| `192.168.10.11` | `cei-i7-31g-swarm02` | Intel Core i7, 31 GiB |
| `192.168.10.192` | `cei-xeon-e3-8g-swarm03` | Intel Xeon E3, 8 GiB |
| `192.168.10.112` | `cei-ryzen5-15g-swarm04` | AMD Ryzen 5, 15 GiB |

A 2-node Swarm was formed on `.13` (manager) and `.11` (worker) per the CEI
engine spec. Nodes `.10` (swarm03) and `.12` (swarm04) needed Docker
installation. Static IPs were applied, MTU 1400 was set for Wi-Fi WAN
compatibility, and stale Wi-Fi routes were disabled.

## Phase 3 ΓÇö OPNsense Wi-Fi WAN Attempts (Aug 5, ~21:00ΓÇô23:00 UTC)

Codex 5.6 Luna configured OPNsense to use iwm0 as a Wi-Fi WAN client
(infrastructure/BSS mode, SSID "Smallwood Hall", WPA2-PSK). The device was
assigned as WAN but the SSID/WPA configuration fields were not present in the
OPNsense version's WAN configuration page ΓÇö the wireless clone needed
credential configuration at the device level, not the interface level. The WAN
remained in `no carrier` state.

## Phase 4 ΓÇö Agent-driven CTF playthrough (2026-08-06 15:37ΓÇô16:09 UTC)

Operator asked to "play the CTF as 10 separate sub-agents," registering users
1ΓÇô10 on one shared team, cost-effectively, sharing found keys.

Codex 5.5 found sub-agents couldn't reach the private LAN target, so it ran it
locally: created `cei-player-1`ΓÇª`10` on `CEI-Agent-Team`, launched environments
via the CTFd launch API, and solved via real SSH/web/API. **24 accepted
submissions** first pass; recovered keys shared on the team.

## Phase 5 ΓÇö Subnet Re-home & New Swarm (Aug 6, ~12:30ΓÇô15:00 UTC)

After exhausting OPNsense fixes, the critical decision was made to **re-home the
Swarm from `192.168.10.0/24` to `192.168.1.0/24`** where upstream internet was
functional. Fizz executed the migration:

- Swarm recreated on `192.168.1.0/24`: manager `.150`, workers `.193`, `.125`
- Fixed stale advertise address ΓÇö re-initialized with `--advertise-addr
  192.168.1.150`
- Redeployed CEI stack from `/home/ismaelrodriguez/deployments/engine-31a6471`,
  updated `ORCHESTRATOR_OFFLINE_HOST` to `.150`
- Recovered from CTFd DB password mismatch using a temporary MariaDB rescue
  container
- Verified all 3 nodes Ready/Active

## Phase 6 ΓÇö CTFd Reset, Game Rollout & Player Support (Aug 6, ~15:00ΓÇô17:20 UTC)

Fizz executed the full event reset:

- Backup taken at `/home/ismaelrodriguez/ctfd-backup-20260806-090853.sql.gz`
- Admin password reset to `CEI-Labs-Admin2026!`
- Games staged: only Bandit (35) + AI Copilot (6) set visible
- All 28 non-admin users and teams deleted, solves and submissions cleared
- Fixed hint display cache bug (409 errors from wiped
  `hint_wallet_catalog_cache`) ΓÇö rebuilt from the orchestrator catalog; hints
  returned
- Krypton unlocked next (8 challenges visible), then Natas (16 visible) when
  the operator asked to "open the last game." All four games ended active.

Player support issues:
- Workhorse (team 22) Krypton instance had never been created ΓÇö Docker overlay
  network race caused silent failure. Recreated via orchestrator API, re-synced
  flag secrets for challenges 36ΓÇô42, verified end-to-end over SSH.
- It went down again after a relaunch ΓÇö same root cause. Recreated with a clean
  non-relaunch create; verified the full Krypton flag chain.
- Bandit per-team passwords had rotated by a relaunch. Fizz set the resume
  point to `bandit19 / bandit19` on port 32002, level-20 target in place.

## Phase 7 ΓÇö Documentation & Post-Mortem (Aug 6-8, 19:00ΓÇô17:40 UTC)

Operator requested a comprehensive event recap PR covering all issues, the
current network state, how many played, how challenges were done, all channel
communications, what was sacrificed (network), and Claude + ChatGPT
conversations for CEI-Labs-relevant items.

Multiple agents coordinated:

- **Honey**: Opened PR #62 on CEI-Labs-Wargames with challenge playthrough,
  participation, pre-event PR history
- **Fizz**: Pulled live server resource usage + CTFd score backup from the
  Swarm, pushed missing WORK_LOGS to the event repo
- **Bumble**: Verified event docs, fixed gap where WORK_LOGS were branch-only
  (opened and merged PR #63)
- **Opencode_DeepSeek**: Opened communications recap (redirected to event repo)

Operator directive (Aug 8, 17:50 UTC): all post-event documentation goes in
**CEI-Labs-Wargames** only. All documentation merged to main on the event repo.
Single remaining gap: Claude/ChatGPT conversation recap (no export files on
disk).

## Key decisions

- Keep the router at baseline (no QoS/segmentation), only local server DNS
  preserved.
- Re-home the Swarm to `192.168.1.0/24` rather than continue fighting server
  WAN egress through OPNsense.
- Run the playthrough locally (agents can't reach the private LAN) instead of
  10 live sub-agents.
- Reset the platform to a clean start with staged unlocks, then open Krypton
  and Natas on request.
- All post-event documentation lives only in CEI-Labs-Wargames event repo.
