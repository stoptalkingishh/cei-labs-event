# Event Recap ΓÇö 2026-08-06 CEI Labs Wargames

A post-event write-up of the 2026-08-06 wargames run: the issues hit and
fixed, the network end-state we landed on, what had to be sacrificed to make
the event happen, and how the challenges were actually played. Source of truth
for the numbers below is the `CEI-LABS` relay channel recap plus the operator
`WORK_LOGS`; live player counts were confirmed at event time by the
orchestrating agent.

## 2. Issues hit and fixed

1. **Stale Swarm advertise address after subnet re-home.** The manager still
   advertised the old dead `192.168.10.13:2377`. Fixed by
   `docker swarm leave --force` + re-init with `--advertise-addr
   192.168.1.150` and rejoining both workers; the stack was redeployed and
   `ORCHESTRATOR_OFFLINE_HOST` updated from `192.168.10.13` ΓåÆ `192.168.1.150`.
2. **CTFd DB password mismatch.** The persistent `cei-labs_ctfd_db_data`
   volume held older passwords that no longer matched `docker/secrets/*.txt`
   ΓåÆ `Access denied for user 'ctfd'`. Recovered with a temporary
   `mariadb:10.11 --skip-grant-tables` rescue container, realigned users, no
   data purged.
3. **Admin password not recoverable.** Existing hash was `$bcrypt-sha256$`.
   Regenerated via CTFd's own `hash_password`, verified round-trip.
4. **User/game reset wiped the hint-wallet display cache.** After deleting
   non-admin users, the hint-wallet API returned `409 no_active_catalog` so
   no hints rendered. Rebuilt `hint_wallet_catalog_cache` from the
   orchestrator's authoritative catalog (revision 9, 3 tracks); no re-sign
   needed. **Lesson:** a full reset must not `DELETE` that cache row.
5. **Per-team Krypton instance silently missing (Workhorse, team 22).** The
   orchestrator create failed on a Docker overlay-network race
   (`network chnet-22-group-krypton not found`) and rolled back, so team 22
   had CTFd flag secrets but **no SSH box at all** while teams 20/21/23/26/27/29
   had one. Recreated via the orchestrator API (fresh per-team secrets, port
   32018) and re-synced flag secrets for challenges 36ΓÇô42. Hit **twice** ΓÇö a
   relaunch teardown-then-recreate on the same network name repeats it.
   **Lesson:** check the orchestrator `instances` table / running services
   before blaming credentials when a user "can't log in."
6. **Bandit per-team passwords rotated by a relaunch.** Workhorse's box had
   been relaunched, regenerating all per-team passwords. Resume point set to
   `bandit19 / bandit19` per the operator, with the level-20 target in place.

## 3. How the challenges were done

Played through the **normal CTFd player flow** ΓÇö real SSH boxes, real web
endpoints, real challenge pages/API. The orchestrating pass registered
10 players (`cei-player-1`ΓÇª`10`) on team `CEI-Agent-Team`, launched their
environments through the CTFd launch API, and solved levels with the intended
techniques (e.g. Bandit's password-chain SSH, Krypton's base64/ROT13/known-
plaintext chain, Natas web exploitation). Recovered keys were shared on the
team so players reused them instead of re-spending. Submissions went through
the public challenge-submit path only ΓÇö **no** reading of CTFd DB, source, or
containers for flags.

| Track | Unique challenges solved (final) | Available |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bandit (Linux Basics) | 22 | 35 |
| Krypton (Cryptography) | 7 | 8 |
| Natas (Web Security) | 11 | 16 |
| AI Copilot Setup | 4 | 6 |

Earlier orchestration pass (agent-driven) contributed an initial
**24 accepted submissions** (Bandit 0ΓåÆ1ΓÇª15ΓåÆ16, Krypton 0ΓåÆ1/1ΓåÆ2, Natas 0ΓåÆ1);
real teams carried the event to the final totals above. Submissions went through
the public challenge-submit path only ΓÇö **no** reading of CTFd DB, source, or
containers for flags.

## 4. Player participation

- **30 total participants** (operator's count ΓÇö source of truth for who took
  part). Of those, **19 registered users / 11 teams** appear in the CTFd DB;
  the delta is people who played but never registered or submitted on the box.
- 9 teams have solves; `admin` and `ctfguy1` are 0-score placeholders.
- **199 accepted solves** from **399 total submissions** across all 4 active
  tracks (65 challenges).
- **Agent-driven playthrough:** 10 registered players (`cei-player-1`ΓÇª`10`) on
  one shared team (`CEI-Agent-Team`), launched via the CTFd launch API with
  recovered keys shared team-wide.

**Final scoreboard (score / solves):**

| Team | Score | Solves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DexMix | 16,080 | 35 |
| Workhorse | 15,830 | 36 |
| Ducks | 13,370 | 26 |
| 0100 | 9,690 | 32 |
| cyberparkour | 4,980 | 20 |
| Nerd_Nuggies | 3,720 | 14 |
| west point grads | 3,130 | 15 |
| Computers are evil | 1,780 | 11 |
| TeamSloth2ElectricBoogaloo | 1,770 | 10 |

Numbers pulled live from the CTFd DB on `192.168.1.150` at event close by the
orchestrating agent. The operator and agents were actively resolving per-team
account/flag issues throughout (see the communications recap in
`docs/event-communications-2026-08-06.md`).

## 5. What was sacrificed to make the event happen (network)

The biggest concession was **network architecture**:

- The **five-VLAN router-on-a-stick** reference design
  (`VLAN10/20/30/40/50` segmentation) was **dropped** for the live box. The
  router carries **two networks**: `em0` LAN/CTF infra on `192.168.10.0/24`
  and `ue1` Player-Wi-Fi on `10.10.32.0/22`. Stale VLAN interfaces
  (`vlan01`ΓÇô`vlan05`) remain configured but unused.
- **Server outbound internet through OPNsense was never restored.** DNS
  resolved locally and pings answered, but server egress through the router
  stayed broken (WAN/NAT/rule path). Rather than keep fighting the router,
  the Swarm was **re-homed to `192.168.1.0/24`**, where it could pull images
  and operate. The CTF platform itself became the priority; the original
  "servers egress through OPNsense" goal was sacrificed to get the event live.
- No aggressive QoS/segmentation was added, per the operator's instruction to
  keep the router at baseline with only local server DNS overrides preserved.

## 6. Systems / services intentionally sacrificed

| Sacrificed | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| Five-VLAN segmented design | Not achievable on the live box in time; two-network layout shipped instead |
| Server WAN egress via OPNsense | Unresolved router path; re-homed Swarm to a working subnet |
| `.12` / `cei-ryzen5-15g-swarm04` | Never joined the Swarm (transport/SSH issues); event ran on 3 nodes |
| OPNsense as CTF egress control point | Served as local DNS/DHCP only for the event |

## 7. Pre-event PR history and last-minute work

Content and platform were built through a long run of merged PRs leading up to
the event. The last several landed the night before / day of, and represent
the final push to make all four tracks playable offline.

**Last-minute PRs (merged 2026-08-04 ΓåÆ 08-06):**

| PR | Merged | What it did |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| #55 `kimi/inventory-drift-check` | 08-04 14:48 | Validate challenge inventory against the build to catch drift |
| #56 `kimi/question-format-readability` | 08-04 21:48 | Make question/hint formatting readable in the launch panel |
| #57 `kimi/banner-glowup` | 08-04 22:52 | Taller, richer ASCII banner art across all three tracks |
| #58 `kimi/wargames-check-fixes` | 08-05 04:43 | Fixes to the wargames check/validation path |
| #59 `kimi/wargames-check-minors` | 08-05 04:43 | Minor follow-up fixes to the check path |
| #60 `kimi/bootstrap-one-liner` | 08-06 00:48 | Make the Windows bootstrap a true one-liner; unpin agent install |

**Earlier build PRs (2026-07-22 ΓåÆ 07-29):** the content-review pass (#1),
offline-dependency audit (#3), Codex fix notes (#4), the P0 deploy/signature/
content fixes (#5, #6, #12, #18), banner and login/art features (#7, #8, #9,
#10), Bandit/Krypton/Natas per-level fixes (#11, #13ΓÇô#19), hint-cost and
theory-structure work (#39), the AI Copilot Setup track (#40) with the
agent-track hidden-by-default and hint-wallet-pending-engine-support follow-ups
(#41, #42), and the agent playability-fix pass (#43).

**Last-minute operational issues** (these were the ones that actually bit on
event day, beyond the PR queue):

- The Swarm was still advertising the stale `192.168.10.13` address after the
  subnet re-home; fixed by re-initializing the manager and rejoining workers
  (Issue 1 above).
- CTFd's DB credentials and the admin hash no longer matched after the
  persistent volume came up ΓÇö rescued without data loss (Issues 2ΓÇô3 above).
- A full user/game reset wiped the hint-wallet display cache (`409
  no_active_catalog`), which had to be rebuilt from the orchestrator catalog
  (Issue 4 above).
- The per-team Krypton instance for Workhorse (team 22) silently failed to
  materialize on an overlay-network race and had to be recreated live (Issue 5
  above).

**Engine repo (`cei-labs-engine`) pre-event build PRs** — the deployment/engine
half of the platform, all merged to its `main` in the run-up to the event
(~33 PRs, 2026-07-10 → event day). The event deployed from engine state
`engine-31a6471` (PR #49 merge). Consolidated from merge history:

- **2026-07-10 — security & image hardening:** shared VNC/operator password
  removal, `kali-rolling` base digest pin, CSRF nonce on admin mapping forms,
  security-audit summary.
- **2026-07-14:** staggered wargame administration.
- **2026-07-15:** PR #2 Fedora common Ansible base role.
- **2026-07-22 — resilience & docs:** participant quotas (#3), stack
  healthchecks (#4), worker-failure recovery (#5), crypto flag-variant
  acceptance (#6), clean-station restore (#7), local-testing/deploy docs
  (#8), offline-install bundle docs (#9).
- **2026-07-23 — the large P0/P1 hardening + theming day (PRs #11–30):**
  credential lifecycle/encryption (#11, #14), VNC/SSH password (#12), hint-wallet
  endpoint (#13) and CTFd plugin (#17), image pinning (#15), browser launcher
  (#16), external hint-wallet secret (#18), CTFd modal theming (#19), Chromium/
  Natas theming (#20), CI test wiring (#22), attacker TLS fallback (#23), reaper
  atomicity (#24), spawn-workspaces hardening (#25), stage gating (#26), theme/
  hint-wallet consistency (#27), hint-wallet frontend (#28), secrets & CI (#29),
  offline-install doc cleanup (#30).
- **2026-08-04:** PR #49 docs index (`engine-31a6471`, the deployed state).

## 8. Server resource usage and score backup

**Score backup (durable, machine-readable):** a full CTFd MariaDB dump was
taken from the `ctfd-db` container on `192.168.1.150` at event close ΓåÆ
`cei-labs-ctfd-backup-2026-08-06.sql` (256 KB, verified valid MariaDB 10.11
dump). It preserves every scoring table ΓÇö `solves`, `submissions`,
`solutions`, `awards`, `challenges`, `flags`, `teams`, `users`, `hints` ΓÇö plus
the custom `wargame_stages` / `audit` / `instance_launcher_team_secrets`
tables. Archived at `/home/ismaelrodriguez/backups/` on the box and mirrored
to the orchestrator agent's workspace. The scoreboard text in this recap is
now backed up in SQL, not just prose.

**Resource usage ΓÇö capacity + post-event idle state (with a caveat).** No
monitoring daemon was running during the event, so **true peak CPU/mem/disk
during live play is not recoverable** ΓÇö nothing logged it. Rather than
fabricate peaks, the below records node capacity and current post-event idle
state as the authoritative record:

| Node | Role (CPU) | RAM | Disk | Load | Notable containers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.150` cei-ryzen5-61g-swarm01 | Swarm leader (12c) | 6.9 / 61 Gi | 53 / 464 G (12%) | 0.22 | ctfd-db 105 MiB, orchestrator 41 MiB, traefik 26 MiB |
| `.193` cei-i7-31g-swarm02 | Worker (12c) | 3.8 / 31 Gi | 13 / 475 G (3%) | 0.17 | ctfd app 370 MiB / 1 Gi |
| `.125` cei-xeon-e3-8g-swarm03 | Worker (8c) | 2.6 / 7.7 Gi | 6 / 231 G (3%) | 0.08 | ctfd-redis 5.1 MiB (4% CPU ΓÇö highest any container showed) + challenge gateway containers |

~20 per-team `chinst`/`chrange` containers ran at 64ΓÇô512 MiB limits, all idle
at capture (0ΓÇô3% CPU), none near its limit.

**Lesson for next time:** to capture real peaks, run a `docker stats` loop or a
node-exporter/Prometheus scrape across the Swarm for the full event window.

## 10. Lessons Learned

1. **Stale advertise address bites after every subnet change.** After re-homing
   the Swarm, `docker swarm init --advertise-addr` must be run ΓÇö the manager
   will silently advertise the old IP otherwise, and workers will successfully
   join but fail to reach the manager.
2. **CTFd DB credential drift is silent until the stack restarts.** The
   persistent volume holds passwords that drift from the compose secrets. Have a
   `mariadb --skip-grant-tables` rescue plan ready.
3. **Full user/game reset must NOT DELETE the hint-wallet cache row.** The
   `hint_wallet_catalog_cache` table is write-once-by-orchestrator; wiping it
   causes `409 no_active_catalog` errors until it's rebuilt from the
   orchestrator catalog.
4. **Subnet re-homing is high-risk.** Each migration point (advertise address,
   stack env vars, DB secrets) is a potential silent failure. Have a documented
   migration checklist.
5. **OPNsense console access is a prerequisite.** Without console/root-GUI access
   to the router, automated agents cannot fix upstream networking issues. Ensure
   console credentials are stored and accessible before event day.
6. **Backup early, backup often.** The CTFd DB backup taken before the reset
   saved the deployment ΓÇö there was no working admin password to recover without
   it.
7. **Monitor during the event.** No `docker stats` monitoring ran during play, so
   real peak CPU/mem/disk usage is unrecoverable. Run a stats loop or
   node-exporter on event day.

## 11. External AI Conversation Recap

The user requested pulling CEI-Labs-related conversations from Claude Desktop,
ChatGPT, and other external AI chat applications. No export files or
conversation transcripts were found in Downloads or the workspace ΓÇö the
applications store conversations in local databases, not as exportable
plain-text files. The following CEI-Labs-related context was identified from
available workspace and repo files:

- `CEI-Labs-CTF-Kickoff.pptx` (in Downloads) ΓÇö event kickoff presentation
- `OKComputer_CEI_Labs_Repo_Review` (in Downloads) ΓÇö a repo review archive of
  `cei-labs-engine`
- Several `cei-fixes.tar.gz` archives in Downloads containing fix patches
- Repo docs in `cei-labs-net/docs/opnsense-end-state.md` reference "prior Claude
  hardware notes" for the OPNsense router hardware discovery
- Engine repo `docs/adversarial-persona-findings-round-2-partial.md` references
  a Claude session performing orchestrator log analysis
- The `adversarial-persona-briefs/` and
  `adversarial-persona-round2-findings/` directories contain Claude-origin
  analysis committed to the repo

To recover the full conversation history, the user would need to:
1. Open Claude Desktop and export the relevant CEI-Labs conversations
2. Open ChatGPT and export/screenshot the relevant conversations
3. Upload or share the exports via the channel

Note: All Codex agent conversations (Codex 5.5, Codex 5.6 Luna) occurred in the
CEI-LABS Buzz channel and are fully captured in `docs/event-communications-2026-08-06.md`.
The external AI gap is limited to private Claude Desktop and
ChatGPT sessions not conducted in-channel.
